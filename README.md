# [PAULSEBASTIANBRUNO.COM](http://www.paulsebastianbruno.com/)

This is the repository containing the source for paulsebastianbruno.com. Moreover, this is the _first_ repository for this site, the beginning of an experiment of sorts. I'm endeavoring (at least, at the moment) to build several different versions of the site and its code, starting simple and then becoming more elaborate, choosing things I've wanted to develop experience with... and opinions about. This is beginning with the Node.js platform, using Express and the EJS templating engine. Future versions will incorporate MongoDB as well as Postgres, and React as well as other advanced FE frameworks (Angular, Ember, Vue, Aurelia, etc.). (It's quite possible that I will soon create other parallel repositories that contain functionally equivalent sites in different languages and frameworks; Ruby/Rails would be my likely first step, then Python/Django and Go/whatever's most appropriate suitable. I'll also revisit Node.js, looking at Koa and Next as alternatives to Express, particularly for "isomorphic" Single Page Applications in React and other FE frameworks.)
